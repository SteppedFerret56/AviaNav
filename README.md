# Flight Route Generator

## Description
This is a website that can currently generate a flight route between two airports. The website reads a large dataset of airports and routes, it then selects two airports at random and checks if they are within a distance of what the user has specified. It can also fine the weather of an airport using the AVWX API.

## Future Plans
My goal for this project is that I want to use an API to display the route on a map. I also want to add a feature that allows the user to see other aircraft currently flying in various different simulators. It would also be nice to have a more refines flight route generator that selects waypoints and calculates fuel consumption. I have many more ideas for this, however I have limited time.
